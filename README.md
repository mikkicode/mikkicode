- 👋 Hi, I’m @mikkicode
- 👀 I’m interested in car adventure, singing, dancing, watching horror and mysteries and thriller movies. 
- 🌱 I'm 18 yrs old, a 1st yr college student. Right now I am literally a starter, I have no idea about anything, I am stil a baby when it comes to coding. But I am willing and want to learn coding for future work, and for me it's cool being able to build something and use it or share it to people who needs it and willing to use it.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... Honestly I don't know what to collaborate on, but I think it's fun to collaborate on working games, or an app. But I think as time goes by, as I get more knowledgable about coding, I can be able to know waht I want to build.
- 📫 Anyone can reach through my email, it's monica.works.coding@gmail.com. 
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: hmmmmm.... well, I received a certificate of "Best Camper" without knowing how. I think that's fun? That when you expect the unexpected, it's more memorable?
